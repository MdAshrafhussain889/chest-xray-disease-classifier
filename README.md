#### Multi-Label Chest X-Ray Disease Classifier

This project provides a Streamlit-based web application for multi-label classification of chest X-ray images using a fine-tuned DenseNet121 model. The model predicts 14 thoracic diseases and generates confidence scores, threshold-based decisions, and visualizations. No retraining is required.

---

## Overview

This application analyzes a chest X-ray image and predicts the likelihood of multiple diseases simultaneously. It uses a DenseNet121 architecture fine-tuned on the NIH ChestXRay14 dataset. The interface is built with Streamlit and runs entirely on the user's local machine.

---

## Supported Disease Classes

The model predicts the following 14 thoracic diseases:

- Atelectasis  
- Consolidation  
- Infiltration  
- Pneumothorax  
- Edema  
- Emphysema  
- Fibrosis  
- Effusion  
- Pneumonia  
- Pleural Thickening  
- Cardiomegaly  
- Nodule  
- Mass  
- Hernia

## How to Run This Project After Cloning

Follow the steps below to set up and run the application on your local system. No retraining is required.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MdAshrafhussain889/chest-xray-disease-classifier.git
cd chest-xray-disease-classifier
````

### 2. Create a Conda Environment

```bash
conda create -n chestxray-env python=3.10 -y
conda activate chestxray-env
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Navigate to the Streamlit Application

# IMPORTANT  
If you paste this version and GitHub STILL shows the “copy” icon on every section, that means:

✔ You added an **extra triple backtick** above or below the README  
✔ OR GitHub cached an older version  

To fix caching:

### 1. Open README → Edit  
### 2. Copy-paste the entire content **again**  
### 3. Commit

---

If you want, I can also:

- Make a **README with table of contents**, badges, and screenshots  
- Add a GitHub profile-level README for your account  

Just tell me.
